            <h2>Notice: Disease Risk Prediction Project</h2>

            This website functions as a medical needs classifier based on a user's query, based on an academic project using publicly available internet data. It's important to note that this tool is <strong>not a real medical clasificator</strong>.
            
            Warnings and Considerations:
            
                Personal Project: This service is a personal undertaking and has not been approved by medical professionals or health institutions.
            
                Data Limitations: The accuracy of the forecast depends on the quality and representativeness of the data adopted in the model. This project employs a particular dataset and may not precisely illustrate the variety of individual circumstances.
            
                Medical Consultation: It is essential to see a medical professional for a thorough health check-up. The details provided by this project do not replace a doctorâ€™s opinion.
            
            Final Note:
            
            This project is offered for educational purposes only and should not replace medical advice. If you are worried about your health, we recommend consulting a healthcare professional.
            
            Your health should come first! See your doctor for individualised, precise guidance.
